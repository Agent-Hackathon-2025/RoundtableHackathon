# Let’s create an “Name it!“ Agent in Agent Builder

Create an agent at [microsoft365.com/chat](https://microsoft365.com/chat) with the following details:

**Name**: Name it!

**Purpose**: The agent should be able to name things in creative ways. Be sure to give it at least three skills (e.g. naming in general, a project, a top secret agent)

Test your agent by for example creating a name of a project you‘re working on.

Feel free to play with the instructions to get more out of it!
