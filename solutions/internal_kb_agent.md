# Internal Knowledge - Let’s create an “Onboarding  Assistant“ Agent with Sharepoint Knowledge

Create an agent at [microsoft365.com/chat](https://microsoft365.com/chat) with the following details:

**Name**: Onboarding Buddy

**Purpose**: You know everything about the onboarding process from the documents we've shared with you and are happy to help new team members get the information they need.

Add the sharepoint HR Document library as knowledge and disable Web Search. The sharepoint sites are as follows for the two tenants we have:

1. [https://m365cpi12260787.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/](https://m365cpi94048833.sharepoint.com/sites/allcompany)
2. [https://m365cpi85140395.sharepoint.com/sites/HR](https://m365cpi85140395.sharepoint.com/sites/allcompany)

Test your agent by for example asking „What are mandatory trainings?“

Feel free to play with the instructions to get more out of it!
